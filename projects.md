<h2> Projects in Deep Learning</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	Leveraging Object movement predictions for Interactive Robot Assistance 		
		<ul>
			<li> This is research work Advised by Prof. Sonia Chernova. Here I  aim to develop an explainable deep generative graph neural network model
(GNN) that performs spatio-temporal object tracking and models the future movement of objects in an environment.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>


	<li>
	Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) based autonomous driving  		
		<ul>
			<li> Trained a model-free RL algorithm TQC (Truncated Quantile Critics) and increased rewards by 17% with experience
replay for navigation in self-driving simulator Donkeycar, outperforming benchmark algorithms DDPG, SAC, and PPO.
			</li>
			<li> Trained a Variational Autoencoder to compress input into a latent space representation and improved rewards by 42%.
			</li>
			<li> Generated a semantic segmentation mask using a pretrained autoencoder to visualize the model for interpretability</li>
		</ul>

<h2> Projects in Computer vision </h2>
<ul>

<li>
<p>
I worked on developing Computer Vision Tools for Non-verbal Communication in Interviews. This research was advised by Prof. James Rehg in Georgia Tech .
<ul>
<li> Trained Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
models for head gesture detection in interviews using OpenFace keypoints generated on the MIT Interview dataset.
</li>
<li>  Experimented with Multi CONV-LSTM models for head gesture detection using AMI Meeting corpus.

<li>
<p>
 Mask R-CNN to perform instance segmentation to analyze the image obtained from the camera mounted on the robot to identify the pixels in the image that contain trash.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
In an attempt to improve object detection of an autonomous vehicle in low light, I worked on a side-project for Low-cost Intelligent vision in Automotives (LIVA). This was later funded for QBuzz conference 2019 as the top 6 finalists.<br> 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
During my undergrad, I developed a vision-based gesture-controlled robotic arm for my final thesis which won the best final year award of my institute, NIT Trichy ( Ranked #9 in India by NIRF). I have published a paper on the same as a first author in the conference Frontiers of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 2020 - <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459104.3459142">Paper in ACM IPS</a>

<h2> Projects in Natural Language Processing</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Symantic Similarity and Toxicity Detection of Questions in Quora - Course project for 7641 Machine Learning. This involves using 
		<ul>
			<li>
		Natural Language Programming methods Tf-Idf Vectorizer, Word2Vec on Quora Question-Pairs dataset and perform machine learning to determine the intent similarity and toxicity of questions. </li>
			<!--<li> Experimenting with state-of-the-art models LSTM, BERT, GRU . </li> -->

<h2> Projects in Machine Learning </h2>

<p> I was enrolled as a remote summer student at Carnegie Melon University in 2020 and completed the course 18-661: Intro to ML for Engineers.
I enjoyed doing the below bonus coursework projects. 

<ul>

<li> Analyzed COVID dataset and performed clustering using scikit-learn and Pandas.
Modeled and analyzed the growth rate of COVID in different states of the USA. </li> 


<li>Created a Decision Tree using scikit-learn to predict if a user will like a song based on the Spotify Data set. </li> 

<li>  Built a custom neural network from scratch using Pytorch. To improve classification accuracy, experimented with Data augmentation, dropout, Xavier weights initialization. </li> 

</ul>
