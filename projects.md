<h2> Projects in Computer vision </h2>
<ul>

<li>
<p>
In an attempt to improve object detection of an autonomous vehicle in low light, I worked on a side-project for Low-cost Intelligent vision in Automotives (LIVA) which was later funded for QBuzz conference 2019 as the top 6 finalists.<br> 
</p>

<li>
<p>
During my undergrad, I developed a vision-based gesture-controlled robotic arm for my final thesis which won the best final year award of my institute, NIT Trichy ( Ranked #9 in India by NIRF). I have published a paper on the same as a first author in the conference  Frontiers of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning- https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459104.3459142

<h2> Projects in Machine Learning </h2>

<p> I was enrolled as a remote summer student at Carnegie Melon University in 2020 and completed the course 18-661: Intro to ML for Engineers.
I enjoyed doing the below bonus coursework projects. 

<ul>

<li> Analyzed COVID dataset and performed clustering using scikit-learn and Pandas.
Modeled and analyzed the growth rate of COVID in different states of the USA. </li> 


<li>Created a Decision Tree using scikit-learn to predict if a user will like a song based on the Spotify Data set. </li> 

<li>  Built a custom neural network from scratch using Pytorch. To improve classification accuracy, experimented with Data augmentation, dropout, Xavier weights initialization. </li> 

</ul>
