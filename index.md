	I am Amirtha Varshini, an incoming Masters in Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, this fall 2021. I am interested in the fields of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I have worked in Qualcomm's Automotive Team for three years, where I developed software on QNX real-time OS for ADAS chipsets (Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems).

I love to experiment with new technology and applying them to real-world problems. I believe in a inclusive world developed responsibly with tech and have contributed to organizations - QWomen India chapter, AIESEC, Engineers without Borders, and National Service Scheme, India.
