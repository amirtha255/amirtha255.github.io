	I am a second-year Masters in Computer Science (ML specialization) student at Georgia Tech. I am interested in the fields of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Autonomous Driving and am actively looking for opportunities starting May 2023. I interned in Amazon Robotics working on Computer vision and Augmented Reality. Previously, I worked in Qualcomm's Automotive Team for three years, where I developed software on QNX real-time OS for ADAS (Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems) chipsets.

I love to experiment with new technology and applying them to real-world problems. I believe in a inclusive world developed responsibly with tech. I like to write and have published blogs in Hackernoon, The Startup, Towards Data Science, and Noteworthy Publications. I enjoy speaking impromptu on topics , a hobby developed as a part of my Toastmasters journey.
