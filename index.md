I am <b>Amirtha Varshini A S</b>, a <b>Machine Learning Scientist II at Montai Therapeutics</b>, where I build 
AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery. My work spans <b>generative modeling, predictive modeling, 
interpretability, and scalable pipelines</b>, combining deep learning methods with rigorous evaluation and 
uncertainty quantification to make models both powerful and transparent. 
</p>

<p>
My path began at <b>Qualcomm</b> working on real-time systems for autonomous driving, grew through a 
<b>Master’s in Computer Science (ML)</b> at Georgia Tech with research in explainable GNNs, and expanded at 
<b>Amazon Robotics</b> applying computer vision and AR. These experiences led me to my current focus: 
building <b>responsible, impactful AI</b> that pushes the boundaries of science and improves the world.
</p>

<p>
Outside of research, I am passionate about <b>communication and creativity</b>. As a <b>Toastmasters speaker</b>, 
I developed a love for impromptu expression, and as a <b>writer</b>, I’ve published essays on technology, ethics, 
and personal growth in platforms such as <i>Hackernoon</i>, <i>The Startup</i>, and <i>Towards Data Science</i>. 
I also find inspiration in <b>travel and exploration</b>—seeking out mountains, coastlines, and new cultures that 
remind me of the joy of curiosity and discovery.
