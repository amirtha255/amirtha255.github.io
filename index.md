	I am a machine learning scientist at Montai Therapeutics, where I am part of a pioneering team that uses AI to discover and develop novel small molecule drugs for chronic diseases. I have a master's degree in computer science from Georgia Institute of Technology, with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.

	I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science (ML specialization) at Georgia Tech. As a graduate student researcher at the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) lab, I developed explainability methods for a dynamic and generative graph neural network (GNN) that performs spatio-temporal object tracking and models the future movement of objects in a home environment. I was also a graduate teaching assistant for the course CS 6603 - AI, Ethics and Society, where I guide students with coding assignments and discussions on topics such as statistics, ethics, and fairness in AIs. I have also worked on various research projects in the fields of deep reinforcement learning and computer vision.  I interned in Amazon Robotics working on Computer vision and Augmented Reality. Previously, I worked in Qualcomm's Automotive Team for three years, where I developed software on QNX real-time OS for ADAS (Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems) chipsets.

I love to experiment with new technology and applying them to real-world problems. I believe in a inclusive world developed responsibly with tech. I like to write and have published blogs in Hackernoon, The Startup, Towards Data Science, and Noteworthy Publications. I enjoy speaking impromptu on topics , a hobby developed as a part of my Toastmasters journey.
