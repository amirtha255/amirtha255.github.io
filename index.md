I am a <b>Machine Learning Scientist at Montai Therapeutics (Flagship Pioneering)</b>, where I develop interpretable generative models to accelerate the discovery of novel small-molecule therapeutics for chronic diseases. My work bridges <b>machine learning research and drug discovery</b>, with a focus on <b>model interpretability, generative flows, and actionable insights for medicinal chemistry</b>.
</p>

<p>
I hold a <b>Master’s in Computer Science (Machine Learning specialization)</b> from <b>Georgia Institute of Technology</b>, where I conducted research in the <b>Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) Lab</b>. There, I built <b>explainability methods for dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs)</b> that perform spatio-temporal object tracking and prediction in home environments. <br>
I also served as a teaching assistant for <i>CS 6603: AI, Ethics, and Society</i>, leading student discussions on fairness, bias, and responsible AI.
</p>

<p>
My experience spans <b>industry and research</b>: <br>
– At <b>Amazon Robotics</b>, I worked on computer vision and augmented reality for robotic perception. <br>
– At <b>Qualcomm</b>, I developed real-time software for <b>autonomous driver assistance systems (ADAS)</b> chipsets on QNX. <br>
– Across projects, I’ve explored deep reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and interpretability techniques.
</p>

<p>
Beyond research, I enjoy <b>writing and science communication</b>—my articles have appeared in <i>Hackernoon</i>, <i>The Startup</i>, <i>Towards Data Science</i>, and <i>Noteworthy</i>. <br>
I’m also passionate about <b>public speaking and impromptu expression</b>, a skill I honed through <b>Toastmasters</b>.
</p>

<p>
At the core, I’m driven by the belief that <b>AI, when developed responsibly, can help build a healthier, more inclusive world</b>.
