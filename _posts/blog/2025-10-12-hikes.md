I’ve been lucky to hike in some of the most breathtaking places across the U.S.  
Here are my favorite hikes so far, in the order I love them:  

1. **Matanuska Glacier, Alaska**  
   My first hike on a glacier — the sheer beauty of the blue ice and the sense of its age made me fall in love with it.

2. **Gold Cord Lake, Hatcher Pass, Alaska**  
   An all-around perfect hike. The sweeping golden meadows along the way, opening up to a pristine alpine lake, were a surreal experience.

3. **Cape Flattery, Washington**  
   The northwesternmost point of the continental U.S. — dramatic cliffs, wild ocean views, and the feeling of standing at the edge of the world.  
   The ancient moss-covered forest gave it a fairytale vibe too.

4. **Blue Lake Trail, North Cascades National Park**  
   A beautiful forested trail leading to an alpine lake with gorgeous views along the way and very few people around.  

5. **Tamolitch Falls (Blue Pool), Oregon**  
   I’m a sucker for alpine lakes, and this clear, deep-blue pool completely mesmerized me.  

These hikes remind me why I love exploring: every step is both grounding and inspiring.
